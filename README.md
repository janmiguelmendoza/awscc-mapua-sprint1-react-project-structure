# Instructions for Scalable React App
This file contains instructions on setting up the React App

### Required Software
1. Install the following for working with the project
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Steps to Use the React App
 1. Clone the Repository
- create a folder where you want to navigate a directory of where you want to clone your repository
- clone the repository using the command "git clone https://github.com/janmiguelmendoza/awscc-mapua-sprint1-react-project-structure"
- navigate it to the project folder you will work on by inputting "cd awscc-mapua-sprint1-react-project-structure"

2. Install Dependencies
- In your terminal type "node -v" to see if you have node.js installed and recognized by your system as well as "npm -v"
- if not yet input in the terminal "npm install"
- This will install all the required packages, including React, React DOM, and other dependencies.

3. Start the Development Server
- In the terminal, run "npm start"
- This command runs the script defined in package.json under "scripts": { "start": "react-scripts start" }
- Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see the React app running

## **Best Practices for Scaling React Apps**
To ensure the app remains scalable and maintainable, follow these best practices:

1. **Modularize Components**: Break down the UI into small, reusable components.
2. **Use State Management Libraries**: For large apps, consider using Redux, Zustand, or Recoil.
3. **Implement Code Splitting**: Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for lazy loading.
4. **Optimize Performance**: Use memoization (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`) and virtualization for large lists.
5. **Efficient Data Fetching**: Use libraries like React Query or SWR for data fetching and caching.
6. **Write Tests**: Use Jest and React Testing Library to test critical paths.
7. **Document Everything**: Keep the codebase well-documented for easier onboarding.
